# Gymtopia
The Best Gym and Nutrition spreadsheet

First, Gymptopia allows users to input body weight, body fat % (BF%), physical dimensions, and personal bests across a number of lifts in order to 
track progress. 

Second, an ingredients database where macros per 100 g are stored has been created and can be added to dynamically. Similarly for recipes, a database of
recipes has been created, allowing for weekly macros to be projected and nutrition targets to be set.
